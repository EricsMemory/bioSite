            <h4>Sophie at the Detroit Art Museum</h4>
                <p>Sophie and I visited the Detroit Art Museum on February 11th, 2024 as an anniversary of our first date. When we originally went over three years ago, we cleared almost the entire museum in a single trip!
                    Each room in the museum was dedicated to different eras of art from various different cultures. She said that she particularly enjoyed the baroque paintings and silverware. At one point, she was so excited about a 
                    piece that she didn't realize how close her face was to it. The security guard called out over the speakers requesting her to "back up a bit!" Still a funny thing to tease her about!

            <h4>Sophie's Clown Heads</h4>
                <p>In school, Sophie enjoyed pottery more than anything. She often brought her pieces back home with her to share with her family, but began to get bored of the basic cups and bowls that her classmates were making.
                    She combined her love for clowns with her love for pottery and began to make innovative vases with faces on them. The faces typically portray some type of emotion and are sometimes inspired by fictional characters.
                    She keeps them on her dresser and stores various trinkets and toys inside of them. She specific likes to focus on the eyes -- in the photo above, they look a little real!

            <h4>Kill Bill</h4>
                <p>Sophie loves action-thriller movies; throw in some horror elements and she's sold. Recently we've been enjoying the Kill Bill series as it's one of her favorites and she wanted to watch them with me.
                    Other than Kill Bill, she is a fan of the Scream franchise, Alien, and Insidious films. Ironically, even though she loves these kinds of movies, she finds it hard not to cover her eyes during the tense moments
                    or when a jumpscare is coming... Sophie says that a lot of her interest in clowns came from the famous Pennywise clown from the It franchise. She found the films amazing and rates them a 10/10!
