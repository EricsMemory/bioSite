                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>My interviewee’s name is Sophie Antilla, and she is a 23-year-old student attending Schoolcraft Community College. She plans on transferring to Wayne State University’s mortuary program after finishing her electives. She decided that she wanted to become a mortician in 2019 to help people in a less conventional way by providing closure to the families of lost loved ones. This is a line of work that many are not comfortable doing, but Sophie understands how beneficial it is and it is a journey she is willing to go down to help bring peace to mourning families.
                    Sophie’s greatest influence in life is her boyfriend, Eric Williams. He inspires her to be the best version of herself and encourages her every step of the way. Whether it be at the gym, or studying for a final exam, Sophie knows that Eric is always going to be there to cheer her on.
                    Sophie’s favorite thing to do after a long day of work is climb into bed and put on a good show to wind down to. Her favorite genres of movies/shows to watch are thrillers, action, and horror films. She’s recently been enjoying the Kill Bill series. When she isn’t watching television, she loves to sculpt, paint, and read manga; in fact, one of her weird talents is sculpting creepy clown heads! She enjoys visiting the art museums in her city and see works of every culture and appreciate their rich histories.
                    If Sophie could have dinner with any person in history, she would love to have dinner with Princess Diana. In her words, she is an iconic leader that was brave enough to go against the norms of the royal family. She has always wanted to visit the castles and cathedrals in France due to their beautiful architecture and deep history. Seeing them in pictures is great, but she would feel privileged to see them in person. If Sophie could spend a week in a fictional universe, she said that she would find it fun to explore the world of Alice in Wonderland. She grew up loving the story and finds the environment intriguing.
